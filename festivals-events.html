							<h2>Festivals</h2>
							<img src="California-img/cochella.jpeg" alt="Cochella Photo" class="image-wrapper" width="200">
							<p>If you look at the news daily, you would know that lots of artists, preformers, and events happend in California. Most would dream to preform in 
							the city of LA, or at the Cochella event, or even to preform at the Rose Bowl. Every day in the State of California, I would not be suprised if there were 
							events, and festivals every single day. It may not be where you live, but California is a big state where los of things happen. </p>

							<h2>Artist</h2>
							<img src="California-img/rosebowl.jpeg" alt="Artist Photo" class="image-wrapper" width="200">
							<p>AS you know there are lots of artist that are home grown in the state of California, most would dream to preform on the biggest stages like the Rose Bowl 
							or the the Cochella Festival. If you saw on the news recently the Weeknd preformed at the Rose Bowl and sold I believe 300,000 tickets. Thats how much people
							care about music here in California. It's the music capital of the world. </p>

							<h2>Events</h2>
							<img src="California-img/roseparade.jpeg" alt="Rose Parade Photo" class="image-wrapper" width="200">
							<p>Califronia has all types of events, we have music festivals, big time artist preforming on the biggest stage, and other things like parades.
							The most well known parade I would believe would be the Rose Parade. The Rose Parade is special becuase different types of people come together, wheter it be 
							friends or family, come together and enjoy the show. You have the 4th of July parade, or even small parades like Dia De Los Muertos where communitys come together
							and celebrate. </p>
						</section>

							<h2>Other</h2>
							<p>The bigger festivals are defintaly the more action packed ones, however don't count out smaller festivals, they provide a smallw crowd, but you feel more embraced with 
							culture, and festivity. Especially when the holiday season hits, all across the state, small communites are joint together to provide a quality experience all year round. </p>

							<h2>Sports</h2>
							<p>If you live in California you are well known or have heard about the sports finatics that love California Sports. You have the Los Angelese Dodgers who've just won the world 
							series, and hosted a parade in LA where 200,000 people showed out for the LA Dodgers. You have die hard soccer fans like LAFC, or LA Galaxy who've woven on the ups on downs on team 
							spirit.<br> <img src="California-img/dodgerparade.jpeg" alt="Dodger Parade" class="image-wrapper" width="200">Then all the way in the South you have the San Diego Padres who hate the Dodger line up. Up North you have the San Francisco Giants, who hate SD and LA. Overall
							there is much loved and hated sports teams, the fans show out love for there team, and show out for there team when they need it.
